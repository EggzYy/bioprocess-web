## Summary

### Completed: 6/22 tasks (27%)
- Core scaffolding and repository setup are complete, but substantial work remains to achieve calculation parity with the legacy scripts.

### Remaining Critical Work:
1. **Frontend JavaScript** - Connect UI to backend
2. **Docker Setup** - Enable containerized deployment
3. **Production Config** - Prepare for deployment

### Time Estimate for Completion:
- Frontend completion: 8-10 hours
- Docker setup: 2-3 hours
- Production deployment: 3-4 hours
- User documentation: 2-3 hours
- **Total: ~18-22 hours**

### Next Immediate Steps:
1. Complete frontend JavaScript to make UI functional
2. Create Docker configuration for easy deployment
3. Write user guide for application usage

The application backend requires further development and validation to match the legacy calculations. Frontend integration and deployment preparation remain outstanding.
